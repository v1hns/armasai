"""Gemma video analysis for ADL problem detection.

Feeds sampled frames to a Gemma multimodal model (via the Google GenAI API) and
asks it to detect the patient's functional difficulties — which ADL tasks are
hard, and the rough physical constraints (range of motion, residual strength,
grip) implied by the footage.

Design rules:
- **Never break the loop.** If there is no API key, the SDK is missing, or the
  call fails, ``analyze`` returns a deterministic stub detection so the
  perception stage still produces a valid ProblemSpec.
- Output is a plain dict (the "detection") that ``cv.backend`` maps onto the
  ProblemSpec contract. Gemma is not asked to emit the contract directly — it is
  asked for observations, and we own the schema mapping.

_PROMPT = """You are the perception module of a custom upper-limb prosthetic
design system. Every subject you analyze is a candidate for an upper-limb
prosthesis: one of their arms/hands is absent, amputated, or non-functional, and
the other arm is compensating for everyday tasks. Your job is to read their
functional situation from the video frames and infer what the prosthesis must
restore.

Reason from the footage:
- Watch which hand/arm actually does the work (reaching, holding, manipulating).
  That is the COMPENSATING (residual functioning) side.
- The opposite side is the one that is missing/non-functional and NEEDS the
  prosthesis. If only one hand is ever visible performing actions, the other
  side is the side to prosthetize.

To read the SPECIFIC action, reason through this internally before answering:
- What object is in the working hand?
- What is the hand DOING to it — twisting, tearing, folding, lifting, pouring,
  cutting? Name the precise verb, not a vague one.
- With only one hand, the person BRACES objects against a surface (sill, table,
  lap, body) to replace the missing second hand. A hand pressing paper onto a
  sill is almost certainly TEARING or FOLDING the paper, NOT wiping the surface.
  Report the intended task, not the incidental surface contact.

Infer and report:
1. primary_action: a short, SPECIFIC description of the single main activity —
   concrete object + precise verb, e.g. "unscrewing a bottle cap", "tearing a
   sheet of paper", "pouring water into a cup". The design is optimized around
   this action.
2. affected_side: "left" or "right" — the side that needs the prosthesis.
3. residual_side: "left" or "right" — the functioning side doing the work.
4. tasks: ADL task categories the primary_action implies, chosen ONLY from
   ["reach", "grasp", "feeding"].
5. rom: per-joint range of motion in DEGREES the prosthesis should provide for
   {shoulder_flexion, elbow_flexion, wrist_rotation}.
6. residual_strength: per-region 0..1 of the residual functioning limb.
7. grip_capacity: a single 0..1 grip the prosthesis must deliver.
8. pain_points: short observed difficulties the prosthesis should solve.

Decide primary_action, affected_side and residual_side ONLY from what the
footage shows — affected/residual are opposite sides. Do not default to a side;
determine it from which hand is visibly doing the work.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object, no prose, of this exact shape (the
"<left|right>" placeholders mean: choose based on the video):

  "primary_action": "drinking water from a bottle",
  "affected_side": "<left|right>",
